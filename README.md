# House-Price-Prediction
A Machine Learning challenge to predict the house prices. It is a simple and basic competition for getting started with Data Science. 

The Repository contains an ipby notebook with complete code in it. You just need to run the code cell by cell to find the error in it 

This code Explains:-   1) Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
                       2) Some Satistical techniques like log transformation, ANOVA(Analysis Of Variance)
                       3) Data Preprocessing (To normalize the data ) i.e Data scalling and one hot encoding 
                       4) Some feature Engeenering
                       5) Finally building the Model using Lasso Regression(A regression technique with Regularization)
  Regularization is a technique that basically avoids Overfitting and Underfitting of the training data
